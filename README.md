# 🌐 Agar.io Clone

This is a simple **Agar.io-inspired game** created purely for educational purposes. The game allows players to control a blob that grows in size by consuming food scattered around the arena. As your blob grows larger, it becomes more challenging to maneuver—but also more dominant!

---

## 🎮 How to Play

- Use **WASD** to control your blob's movement:
  - **W**: Move Up
  - **A**: Move Left
  - **S**: Move Down
  - **D**: Move Right

- Your goal is to consume as much food as possible to grow larger.
- The size of your blob increases based on the **kilogram value** in the food. A higher value means your blob grows faster when consuming it!
